My hometown Xinyang is especially known for *Xinyang Maojian*, which is one of the most famous green teas in China. In addition, I am from Gushi County in Xinyang, which is well known for its unique and tasty dish called *Gushi Goose Stew*. It has a very special flavor and is really popular among visitors.

So if you have the chance, I warmly welcome you to visit Henan and enjoy the food, culture, and hospitality of my hometown.

### introduce your hobbies

One of my favorite hobbies is playing badminton. At first, I started playing just to exercise and keep healthy. Later, I found it really interesting and enjoyable, so it gradually became one of my hobbies. Through badminton, I also made many good friends and learned how to cooperate and communicate better.

Another hobby of mine is reading. Reading helps me calm down and think more deeply. It also allows me to learn new things and explore knowledge that I am curious about. I believe reading not only enriches my mind but also broadens my vision.

### introduce your strengths and weaknesses: Precocity cannot replace experience

My strength is that I am outgoing and good at communicating with people. I also like to make plans and stay organized, which helps me work efficiently.

My weakness is that sometimes I am too confident and a bit stubborn. But I see this as a chance to grow. I remind myself that precocity cannot replace experience, so I try to listen more, be open-minded, and learn from others.

#### favorite ML algorithm: Adaboost

My favorite machine learning algorithm is AdaBoost. It is simple but powerful. The idea is to combine many weak classifiers, like small decision trees, into a strong one by focusing on the hard-to-classify samples. I like it because it works well without much parameter tuning and shows the power of ensemble learning. It also inspires me to try combining different methods to solve problems.

#### favorite professional course

My favorite professional course is Data Structures. When I was a freshman, I joined the ACM laboratory and started to learn algorithms and data structures.
