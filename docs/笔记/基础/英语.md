  Good morning/afternoon, professors.

  My name is Zheng Huiyun, and I was born in Xinyang, Henan Province. I am currently an undergraduate student at  Henan University, majoring in Computer Science. My academic performance has been consistently outstanding, ranking 2nd in my major, and I have passed the CET-6 with a score of 465. In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton and reading.

  During my freshman and sophomore years, I joined the ACM Laboratory of my school. After a year of systematic training, I gained a solid foundation in algorithms and problem-solving. I participated in several national programming competitions and achieved notable results, such as the National Silver Medal in the 2024 CCPC for Girls, the National Team Second Prize and Individual Third Prize in the CCCC . These experiences have not only strengthened my algorithmic thinking but also improved my teamwork and problem-solving skills under pressure.

  In my junior year, I actively engaged in research projects. I participated in the urban spatial structure identification research at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, which gave me a deeper understanding of how to conduct scientific research. I also contributed to the writing of the paper *A BIKE Weak Key Identification Scheme Based on Ensemble Learning*, which further enhanced my skills in data analysis, model design, and academic writing. These experiences have inspired me to continue exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and its applications in real-world problems.

  Thank you for listening.

- introduce your research projects, contributions, innovations

  - introduction & contribution：照搬自我介绍
  - innovations：是第一个做的人，精准找到了影响合作效率的点，并且提出了在 training 中得到它们的方法。

- why apply for PhD

  > first it is because, the work and life of faculties really attract me.
  >
  > 如果没能成功成为 faculty，也可以进工业界做研发，也很有趣。
  >
  > in general, i'm applying PhD to 接近目标，提升竞争力。

  Why do I apply for a PhD program? 

  First, the work and life of university faculty members truly attract me. I enjoy the idea of conducting in-depth research, exploring challenging problems, and having greater flexibility to manage my own time and projects. 

  Second, even if I do not eventually become a faculty member, I believe a PhD degree will still provide me with strong opportunities in the industry, especially in R&D roles, which are also exciting and intellectually rewarding. 

  In general, I am applying for a PhD to get closer to my long-term career goal and to enhance my overall competitiveness in both academia and industry. 

- your plan for PhD years

  > I'll work hard to develop the necessary qualities of an independent researcher, including to find a meaningful idea, to implement my idea through coding, to conduct experiments, to write papers and give talks.
  >
  > To do this, i'll work hard to publish meaningful papers, take part in our National Fund Projects and projects with industry, and also keep good relationships with my supervisor and collaborators.

  My plan for the PhD years:

  During my PhD studies, I will work hard to develop the essential qualities of an independent researcher. This includes identifying meaningful research problems, implementing solutions through coding, conducting rigorous experiments, writing high-quality papers, and delivering clear presentations.

  To achieve this, I will aim to publish impactful research papers, actively participate in National Science Foundation projects and collaborative projects with industry, and maintain close and constructive relationships with my supervisor and collaborators. I believe that by combining solid research output, active project involvement, and effective communication, I can maximize my growth and contribution during my PhD years.

- why choose fudan / ruc gaoling / buaa / 计算所 / Institute of Automation / sjtu / tsinghua

  - xx is really nice.
  - and i'm really interested in machine learning, (DL / RL), (network system).
  - and just the same as the faculties in xx, i also believe that ML / DL / RL techniques can be utilized in many realistic fields, to develop new methods, to improve the existing methods, to bring us a wide range of probabilities, and to push the boundaries of science and technology.
  
  Why do I choose this university/institute?
  
  I’m attracted by the strong research environment, excellent faculty, and advanced facilities here. My main interests are in machine learning, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and network systems, which align closely with many professors’ research. I believe these techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems, develop new methods, and push the boundaries of science and technology. This environment will help me grow as a researcher and prepare me for future contributions in academia or industry.
  
  BTW, the university’s location is excellent, and I truly enjoy living in XX city.
