## Performance Comparison

> As shown in Table 1, the experimental results **demonstrate that** O-Researcher-RL **establishes a new state-of-the-art among** open-weights deep research models, **significantly outperforming** concurrent open-source works such as Tongyi-Deep Research [63]1 and MiroThinker [64]. Furthermore, our model **transcends the capabilities of leading** search-enhanced commercial LLMs, **surpassing** both the GPT-5 baseline [58] and OpenAI O3 [58], while also **outperforming** specialized proprietary agents like Perplexity Deep Research [55]. This indicates that our framework successfully **bridges the performance gap** between open-source models and top-tier closed-source systems.

> Furthermore, in terms of relevance (KPR), O-Researcher-72B **substantially outperforms（大大优于）** standard search-enhanced LLMs and **effectively rivals（有效竞争，没打过但是也不相上下了）** specialized agents, demonstrating a robust ability to synthesize comprehensive reports that satisfy complex user information needs
